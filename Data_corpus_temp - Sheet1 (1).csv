What is the scope in Core Engineering after 3 years?,"It is difficult to say exactly what the scope of ""core engineering"" will be after 3 years, as this can vary depending on the specific field or industry in which you are working. However, in general, core engineering refers to the fundamental principles and practices of engineering that are applicable across a wide range of fields and industries. These principles and practices include problem-solving, design, analysis, testing, and the use of math, science, and technology to solve real-world problems. After 3 years of working in core engineering, you can expect to have a strong foundation in these skills, as well as a broad understanding of the various fields and industries in which engineering is applied."
